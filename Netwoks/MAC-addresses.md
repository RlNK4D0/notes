These are a *unique* identifier assigned to a **NIC** *(network interface controller)* for it to be used as a *network address* to communicate within a network

This is common in [[IEEE-802]] networking tech, including [[Ethernet]],*WI-FI*, and [[bluetooth]]

In the [[OSI-model]], MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the *Data link layer*

#### Composition of MAC addresses

MAC addresses are composed of six groups of 2 **HEXadecimal** digits, separated by hyphens, colons or without a separator

example -> **A1:B4:C5:C1:DD:3E**
