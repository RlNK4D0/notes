Secure Shell, is s way to connect securely to remote computers and services, like [[GIT]] repositories

ssh uses a pair of keys, one public one private 

ssh needs the archives to be only accessible by your user [[chmod]]
```
chmod 600 key key.pub
```

# keys
the *public key* its shared with the service like **github** and the *private key* its stored safely in your device

the *public key* is like a lock, securing something behind it and the *private key* is they key to unlock that content
