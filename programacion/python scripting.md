##### why?
python is much more readable, more reusable but it might be slower than [[bash scripting]], maybe i can use both at the same time for my projects

---

focus on shell scripting for now
libs:
click library, replacement for argparse, optpars
pathlib module

###### what is parse? 
[[parse]] -- complete someday
